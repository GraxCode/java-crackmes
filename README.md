Run each file with `java -jar <crackme>.jar <key>`, if that does not work, use `java -cp <crackme>.jar <class with main method> <key>`.
The goal is to find a working key to input as argument, without bruteforcing the program, but with writing a keygen (that should not take longer than 30 seconds) or calculating the key by hand. Solutions with only the key are *not* accepted, you should explain how you solved it and attach the keygen you wrote (if you used one). Every crackme has been tested for a working key. There can be multiple solutions for some crackmes, but you do not have to find every solution. If you want to, you can submit solutions via issues, and I will add them to the repository.
